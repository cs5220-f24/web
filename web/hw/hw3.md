Due 2024-10-29.

The goal of this homework is to get you up and running CUDA code on Perlmutter.
Using code at <https://github.com/cs5220-f24/hw3>, you should

- Edit `vec_add.cu` to actually use CUDA with a grid-stride loop
- Adapt the submission script to run with `nvprof` on Perlmutter
- Submit the `vec_add.cu` code and the output of `nvprof`

See the class slides and <https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/even-easier-introduction-cuda/>
