This is the course material repository for Cornell [CS 5220][cs5220]
for the Fall 2024 semester.  This repository will contain lecture
notes, homework assignments, reference codes, utilities, and the

or other materials here; also, feel free to post pull requests if you
see items that ought to be corrected.
